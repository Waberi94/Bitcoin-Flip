# YOUR PROJECT TITLE: Coin Flip
#### Video Demo:  <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-HrmXEGxwI&ab_channel=bar0uu>
#### Description:

This is a simple web application called **Bitcoin Flip** that simulates flipping a coin and displays the result as either "Heads" or "Tails" along with a corresponding animation of a coin flipping. The project consists of three main files: `index.html`, `script.js`, and `styles.css`.

## Files Overview

### `index.html`
This file contains the structure and content of the web page. It includes:
- HTML structure with `<head>` and `<body>` tags.
- Meta tags for character set and viewport configuration.
- Title set to "Coin Flip".
- Link to `styles.css` for styling.
- A container `div` with a heading, a coin container, a button for flipping the coin, and a paragraph element to display the result.
- The JavaScript file `script.js` is linked at the end of the `<body>` tag for interactivity.

### `script.js`
This file contains the JavaScript code responsible for flipping the coin and updating the result. It includes:
- A function `flipCoin()` triggered when the button is clicked.
- Retrieval of DOM elements for the result and the coin.
- Generation of a random number (0 or 1) to represent "Heads" or "Tails".
- Update of the result text based on the random number generated.
- Rotation of the coin element to simulate the flipping animation based on the result.

### `styles.css`
This file contains the CSS styles to visually enhance the web page. It includes:
- Styling for the `<body>` element, setting background color and image.
- Styles for the container, including text alignment and positioning.
- Styles for the coin container and the coin itself, specifying dimensions, background image, and animation properties.
- Animation keyframes for the coin flip effect.
- Styles for the button and result paragraph, defining appearance and typography.

## Usage
To use the application:
1. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
2. Click the "Flip Coin" button to simulate flipping the coin.
3. The result (either "Heads" or "Tails") will be displayed, along with the corresponding animation of the coin flipping.

## Development
This project can be further developed by adding features such as:
- Keeping track of the number of times the coin is flipped.
- Implementing multiplayer mode with simultaneous coin flipping.
- Enhancing the visual effects and animations.
- Adding sound effects for a more immersive experience.

Feel free to fork and modify the project according to your needs and preferences!
